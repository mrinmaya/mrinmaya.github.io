# Artificial Intelligence in Education
### <font color=gray>ETH Zürich, Autumn Semester 2024 </font>: [Course catalog](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=182452&semkez=2024W&lang=en)

___

## Course Description
The course will be centered around analyzing educational data using AI methods and methodological and system-focused perspectives on designing AI systems for education.

The course will start with an introduction to data mining techniques  (e.g., prediction, structure discovery, visualization, and relationship mining) relevant to analyzing educational data. We will then continue with topics on personalization in AI in educational technologies (e.g., learner modeling and knowledge tracing, self-improving AIED systems) while showcasing example applications in areas such as content curation, automatic assessment and dialog-based tutoring. Finally, we will cover ethical challenges associated with using AI in student facing settings.

Face-to-face meetings will be held every fortnight, although students will be expected to work individually on weekly tasks (e.g., discussing relevant literature, working on problems, preparing seminar presentations).

Students will be expected to:
- engage in presentations and active in-class and asynchronous discussion, 
- work on problem-sets exemplifying the use of educational data mining techniques.

### **Grading**
This is a research driven, hands-on class. Your participation is important.

The final assessment will be a combination of: 
- 60% - One take-home assignment;
- 40% - Paper presentation in class OR a critique of a paper discussed in class;

No written exams! Our focus is on learning and continuous evaluation.

<!-- classroom participation, graded exercises, research paper presentation and the project. There will be 3 exercise sets which will be a mix of theoretical and implementation problems. Exercises will be released roughly every 4 weeks, and will total to 40% of your grade. Classroom participation (writing class presentation summaries and discussion forum participation) will account for 20% of the grade. Research paper presentation will account for 10% of the grade and the project will account of the rest of the grade (30%). There will be no written exams. -->

**Lectures:** Thu 13:15-15:00 (ML F38)

**Exercise Sessions:**  Thu 15:15-16:00 (ML F38)

**Discussion forum:** [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=17844) 

**Textbooks:**
We will not follow any particular textbook. We will draw material from a number of research papers.
