We are a research group in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/) within the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at the [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/). We are also part of the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/), the [Ellis Society](https://ellis.eu/) and the [ETH Zurich - EPFL Joint Doctoral Program in the Learning Sciences](https://lse.ethz.ch/doctoral-program-in-learning-sciences.html).

We build machine learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge discovery and Reasoning. We also work on problems in the intersection of Natural Language processing and Education.

Our current focus areas include:
1. Reasoning with Natural Language, particularly Neuro-Symbolic and Causal Approaches
2. NLP for long contexts, including models for Coreference and Discourse
3. NLP Applications, particularly QA, Dialog and MT
4. NLP for Educational Applications

We are located in the E floor of the [CAB building](https://ethz.ch/services/en/service/rooms-and-buildings/building-orientation/gebaeude.html?args0=CAB) in the [beautiful](https://www.zuerich.com/en) city of Zurich in Switzerland. We regularly exchange ideas and work with our neighbors in [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) and the [Zurich-NLP group](https://zurich-nlp.ch/), as well as with our colleagues in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/).

We are not actively looking for PhD students at this time. However, we are currently offering several master/bachelor thesis projects.

We have an opening for a postdoc!

We are grateful for funding from [SNF](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx), [ETH Research Grants](https://ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-grants.html), [Haslerstiftung](https://haslerstiftung.ch/), the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/).
