We are a research group in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/) within the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at the [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/). We are also part of the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/).

We build machine learning models for natural language processing, knowledge discovery and reasoning. We also work on problems in the intersection of natural language processing and education.

Our current focus areas include:
1. Representation learning and reasoning with natural language 
2. Representation learning and reasoning with knowledge graphs
3. Coreference resolution and Discourse
4. NLP for long texts
5. NLP for educational applications

We are located in the E floor of the [CAB building](https://ethz.ch/services/en/service/rooms-and-buildings/building-orientation/gebaeude.html?args0=CAB) in the [beautiful](https://www.zuerich.com/en) city of Zurich in Switzerland. We regularly exchange ideas and work with our neighbors in the [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/), as well as with our colleagues in the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/).

 **We are always looking for strong and motivated PhD students to join our research group. However, we are quite selective and only have around 1-2 positions every year.** [(Please read this before sending us an email)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies).**!**

**We are also offering various master thesis projects.**

We are grateful for funding from [SNF](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx), [ETH Research Grants](https://ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-grants.html), [Haslerstiftung](https://haslerstiftung.ch/), the [ETH AI center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/).
