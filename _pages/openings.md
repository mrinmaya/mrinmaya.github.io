# Bachelor, Master projects and Internships
### Bachelor/Master projects for ETH Zurich students
If you are a Master student at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, contact me (or any group member) by email with your CV and transcripts. We maintain a list of available thesis projects [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6VXXAUmfEURldrbPtCiIFAOW4UKoXT49fTvTSOsRTk/edit#). However, you can also propose your own topic.

If you are a Bachelor at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, you must have succesfully completed one of the two NLP classes in the department (252-3005-00L-Natural Language Processing or 263-5000-00L-Computational Semantics for Natural Language Processing). Feel free to contact me (or any group member) by email with your CV and transcripts. Some available thesis projects are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6VXXAUmfEURldrbPtCiIFAOW4UKoXT49fTvTSOsRTk/edit#). You can also propose your own topic.

### Internship/Bachelor/Master projects for students at other universities
We usually have limited bandwidth to take on bachelor or master students from other universities. However, if you think you are a very good fit, feel free to reach out.

If you are interested in an internship, please apply to our [Student Summer Research Fellowship program](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/studies/summer-research-fellowship.html) (next deadline: December 2021). If you think you are a good fit and have some research experience already, you can reach out. However, please note that we get too many internship requests. **We may not be able to respond to your emails**.

Also consider applying to the [ThinkSwiss Scholarships](https://thinkswiss.org/) for internships and short term stays. You can refer to the ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship pages to support your stay in Switzerland for up to 3 months and the deadline for applying is in January each year.

**Members of various minority groups in academia are especially encouraged to apply.**
