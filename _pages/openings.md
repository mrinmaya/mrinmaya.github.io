# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! However, we are quite selective and only have around 1-2 PhD positions every year.


### Current open positions

You find the current job openings here:
[Opening 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/GeneralPostdoc_2019_v01.pdf),
[Opening 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PPMS_PhD_2019_v01.pdf).

It might be interesting to look at some past job advertisements. While the projects keep changing, the themes are still roughly the same. You can download them [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PD.pdf), [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD1.pdf), or [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD2.pdf).

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.



### Bachelor/Master projects for ETH Zurich students
If you are a Bachelor or a Master student at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Internship/Bachelor/Master projects for students at other universities
We usually do not have the bandwidth to take on interns, bachelor or master students from other universities. However, if you think you are an **exceptionally** good fit, feel free to reach out.
