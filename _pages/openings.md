# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! However, we are quite selective and only have around 1-2 PhD positions every year.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD, please note the following:
1. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree or equivalent, please submit an application through the [departmentâ€™s admission system](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/phd-application) and send me an email containing your CV.
2. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree and are interested in interdisciplinary research (e.g. education or human aspects of NLP), please consider applying to the [ETH AI center PhD fellowship](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html).
3. If you do not have a M.Sc., you may apply to the [Direct Doctorate in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html) and express specific interest in our research group in your application.

I am by myself not looking for a Postdoc. However, I may have a position for a Postdoc jointly with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) especially throught the [ETH AI center Postdoc fellowship program](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html)

### Bachelor/Master projects for ETH Zurich students
If you are a Bachelor or a Master student at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Internship/Bachelor/Master projects for students at other universities
We usually do not have the bandwidth to take on interns, bachelor or master students from other universities. However, if you think you are an **exceptionally** good fit, feel free to reach out.
