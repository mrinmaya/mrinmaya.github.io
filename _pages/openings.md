# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! However, we are quite selective and only have around 1-2 PhD positions every year.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD, please note the following:
1. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree and are interested in interdisciplinary research, please consider applying to the [ETH AI center PhD fellowship](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html) and mention my name in your application.
2. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree and are interested in [CLS](https://learning-systems.org/) (our joint PhD program with Max Planck), please apply and mention my name in your application. Please note the early application deadline.
3. If you do not have a M.Sc., you may apply to the [Direct Doctorate in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html) and express specific interest in our research group in your application. You should also tag [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) in your application if you are interested in NLP.
4. Finally, if you cannot apply to any of the above application deadlines, you can also submit an application through the [departmentâ€™s admission system](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/phd-application) at any time. In this case, it is okay to send me an email stating your interest with your CV. **This year, we are primarily admitting PhD students through modes 1, 2 and 3.**


We may also have an opening for a Postdoc. In particular, we may be able to host a Postdoc jointly with [Ryan Cotterell's group](https://rycolab.io/) especially throught the [ETH AI center Postdoc fellowship program](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html)

### Bachelor/Master projects for ETH Zurich students
If you are a Master student at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, contact me (or any group member) by email. We maintain a list of available thesis projects [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6VXXAUmfEURldrbPtCiIFAOW4UKoXT49fTvTSOsRTk/edit#). However, you can also propose your own topic.

If you are a Bachelor at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, you must have succesfully completed one of the two NLP classes in the department (252-3005-00L-Natural Language Processing or 263-5000-00L-Computational Semantics for Natural Language Processing). Feel free to contact me (or any group member) by email.

### Internship/Bachelor/Master projects for students at other universities
I usually have limited bandwidth to take on bachelor or master students from other universities. However, if you think you are a very good fit, feel free to reach out.

If you are interested in an internship, please apply to our [Student Summer Research Fellowship program](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/studies/summer-research-fellowship.html) (next deadline: December 2021). If you think you are a good fit and have some research experience already, you can reach out. However, please note that we get too many internship requests. **We may not be able to respond to your emails**.

Also consider applying to the [ThinkSwiss Scholarships](https://thinkswiss.org/) for internships and short term stays. You can refer to the ThinkSwiss Research Scholarship pages to support your stay in Switzerland for up to 3 months and the deadline for applying is in January each year.

**Members of various minority groups in academia are especially encouraged to apply.**
