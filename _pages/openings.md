# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! However, we are quite selective and only have around 1-2 PhD positions every year.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD, please note the following:
1. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree or equivalent, please submit an application through the [departmentâ€™s admission system](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/phd-application) and then also send me an email containing your CV.
2. If you have (or expect to obtain soon) a M. Sc. degree and are interested in interdisciplinary research, please consider applying to the [ETH AI center PhD fellowship](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html).
3. If you do not have a M.Sc., you may apply to the [Direct Doctorate in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html) and express specific interest in our research group in your application. You should also consider tagging [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) in your application if you are interested in NLP.

I am by myself not looking for a Postdoc. However, I may be able to host a Postdoc jointly with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/) especially throught the [ETH AI center Postdoc fellowship program](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html)

### Bachelor/Master projects for ETH Zurich students
If you are a Bachelor or a Master student at ETH Zurich looking for a thesis project, contact me (or any group member) by email. We maintain a list of available thesis projects [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6VXXAUmfEURldrbPtCiIFAOW4UKoXT49fTvTSOsRTk/edit#). However, you can also propose your own topic here.

### Internship/Bachelor/Master projects for students at other universities
I usually do not have the bandwidth to take on bachelor or master students from other universities. However, if you think you are an **exceptionally** good fit, feel free to reach out.

If you are interested in an internship, please apply to our [Student Summer Research Fellowship program](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/studies/summer-research-fellowship.html). If you think you are an **exceptionally** good fit and have significant research experience already, feel free to reach out.
